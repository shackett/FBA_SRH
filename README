Sequences: 

	- CHEBI_compound - a list of all of the metabolites referenced in the sbml reconstruction, associated with a standard name & structural information É

	- orf_genomic_1000.fasta - the mRNA sequence of all transcripts, including introns & 1000 bp upstream & downstream (couldn't get just the UTR)

	- orf_genomic - from ATG to AUG/UAG/UAA including introns for all high-confidence transcripts

	- rna_genomic - non-mRNA RNAs - tRNA, rRNA É

	-METAdict.tsv - correspondence between CHEBI IDs and consensus names

	-PROTcomposition.tsv - Protein Name + ID with counts of amino acids

	-RNAcomposition.tsv - Gene Name with counts of nucleotides



generated by sbml_FBA_parser_forYeast.py:
	
	- rxn_yeast_nocomp.tsv: reactions and their associated stoichiometry as well as the enzyme (modifier) that catalyzes the rxn.  The internal names of all members are cross-referenced to spec_yeast_nocomp.tsv and then associated with a meaningful CHEBI / uniprot or SGD designation in species_par_yeast_nocomp.tsv

	- spec_yeast_nocomp.tsv: association between an internal id and a species id, that is unique for a metabolite or protein.  compartment information (extraceullar versus intracellular) is included.

	- species_par_yeast_nocomp.tsv: associates a species id with references to a meaningful id; either CHEBI (for metabolites) or UniProt/SGD (for proteins).
	





EcoliYeastMatch >

In order to incorporate thermodynamic information into the yeast flux-balance model, the gibbs free energy's available for ecoli rxns and species must be associated with the corresponding yeast ids.
This involves converting yeast ChEBI IDs to KEGG ids and then associating these yeast KEGG ids with ecoli KEGG ids

- CTSpy.py (written by Dave Robinson): All conversions between metabolite names & standards were done using the chemical translation service (CTS).

- ecoliYeastMatch.py: Because the same chemical can have multiple ChEBI or KEGG ids, the association is made more degenerate by first searching ChEBI ids to metabolite synonyms and then re-searching these against KEGG ids, to get a set of possible KEGG ids.

- ecoliNameDict.txt - correspondence between geneID (unknown standard) and gene name. Downloaded from: http://coli.berkeley.edu/ecoli/gene.txt

- gene-links.dat - correspondence between geneIDs and gene name, etc.  Downloaded from BioCyc

Prepare the absolute concentrations of metabolites, so that these can be used to modify the reaction free energy

- yeast absolute concentration yifan - absolute concentrations of intracellular metabolites

- yeastNames.py - conversion between names of metabolites and possible ChEBI and KEGG ids
